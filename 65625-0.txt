                           THE FIRST OF MAY.


    Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg
      By the Cinque Ports he swore,
    He’d make an Exhibition
      That was never seen before.
    By the Cinque Ports he swore it,
      And named an opening day:
    And letters wrote to left and right,
    To bid the universe unite
      Upon the First of May.

    Left and right the letters went,
      To city, realm, and coast;
    And answers came most civilly,
      By the return of post.
    Shame on the lazy Nation,
      That will not join her share,
    With Albert and Britannia,
      To swell the World’s great Fair!

    The parcels and the packages
      Come bundling in amain,
    By many a creaking waggon;
      By many a flying train;
    By many a van of Pickford’s,
      That filled with ponderous care,
    Makes every passer by exclaim,
      “Good gracious, just look there!”

    From autocratic Russia,
      Where growls the unctuous Bear,
    Who covers native Poles with grief,
      And British polls with hair;
    From France, the land of elegance,
      And witty elocution,
    Whose clever hands make all things well
      Except a constitution;

    From the far-off Republic,
      On Transatlantic waves,
    Who blazons stars of liberty
      Upon the stripes of slaves;
    From where the Alpine snows surround
      The workshops of the free;
    From where in fettered sadness burns
      The muse of Italy!

      *       *       *       *       *

    The Prince and the Commission
      A weary life they led:
    No time had they for dining,
      And rather less for bed.
    They couldn’t choose a building,
      They couldn’t find a site:
    And our good Queen Victoria
      Grew tired--as well she might.

    For good advice in pamphlets,
      And prophecies in calf,
    And groans to make him shudder,
      And sneers to make him laugh,
    And hints and threats and warnings,
      Plan, diagram, and view,
    Choked up the Prince’s davenport,
      And filled his pockets too.

    “To eastward and to westward,”
      ’Twas said, “alarm is spreading;
    “The foreigners will eat us
      “Out of house and home and bedding;
    “Taxation will be trebled,
      “And sadder far to tell,
    “Thanks to the horrid papers,
      “_The tickets will not sell!_”

    I wis, in all the Palace
      There was no heart so bold,
    But wished himself well out of it,
      When that ill news was told.
    Up rose at length Prince Albert,
      Up rose the whole Commission,
    And at the footstool of the throne
      They laid the Exhibition.

    Just then burst in a messenger,
      With cold sweat on his brow:
    “Look here, look here, my gracious Prince!
      “They say there’ll be a row!”
    Upon the fatal newspaper
      Prince Albert turned his eye,
    And saw a night of wretchedness
      Darken his sunny sky.

    And plainly and more plainly
      In history’s page he read,
    The gibes and jeers and sarcasms,
      Heaped on his luckless head:
    And the stigma of ridiculous,
      More terrible than guilt,
    Stamped by unborn Macaulays,
      On “the House that Albert built.”

    And plainly and more plainly
      He heard the words of doom,
    When all the year’s expenses
      Are checked by Joseph Hume;
    And the outcry of the journals,
      And the angry people’s hisses,
    And his loving consort’s mild reproof,
      “You know whose doing _this_ is!”

    And the Prince’s voice was sad,
      And dim his eye of blue:
    “It’s come to this, my gracious wife,
      “We don’t know what to do!
    “There’s not a soul contented;
      “The tickets will not sell;
    “And now the papers prophesy
      “Such things I fear to tell!

    “The French will spoil our morals,
      “The Russians cheat and _knout_ us--
    “They’ll haunt us like musquitoes,
      “Like snakes they’ll twine about us--
    “The Chartist and the Communist
      “Will hand in hand combine,
    “And break the Crystal Palace
      “About your head and mine!

    Then out spake Queen Victoria,
      And brightly glanced her eye:
    “I never heard such nonsense!
      “I only wish they’d try!
    “Don’t mind those vile reports, dear--
      “’Twill all come right, you’ll see:
    “Just keep the workmen moving,
      “And leave the rest to me!

    “I’ll order out the carriage,
      “My royal robes I’ll wear,
    “And though the crowd be millions deep,
      “No matter--I’ll be there!
    “And in the face of rough John Bull,
      “Whate’er he means to do,
    “I’ll smile until he smiles again,
      “And gives a cheer for you!

    “There’ll be some foolish people there,
      “Indeed, where are they not?
    “Perhaps they’ll throw a stone or two,
      “Or fire a little shot:
    “They never hit me yet, dear,
      “Except upon my bonnet;
    “So don’t persuade me not to go--
      “I’ve set my heart upon it!

    “Unpack the parcels, gentlemen,
      “As quickly as ye may:
    “Tell all your foreign colleagues,
      “I’ll hear of no delay!
    “Though foemen league in millions,
      “We’ll charm away their malice,
    “And walk together, arm in arm,
      “Right through the Crystal Palace!”

    “My heart of hearts,” the Prince replied,
      “You talk just like a book.”
    And the relieved Commissioners
      Cheered till the throne-room shook:
    And through the streets of London,
      Fast, fast, the news was borne;
    And strange was the commotion,
      Upon the morrow morn.

    Then none would hear of waiting;
      Then all were wild to go;
    Then did the ticket offices
      With claimants overflow;
    And every British lady
      Spared neither rhyme nor reason,
    To wring from consort or from sire
      A ticket for the season.

    Bright are the silks and satins
      That gleam in Howell’s panes;
    Matchless the lace of Hayward,
      The ribbon at Redmayne’s;
    Best of all gloves are Melnotte’s,
      That mortal ever wore;
    Best of all treats a young bride loves
      A Continental tour.

    But now, o’er Howell’s counter,
      No fairy buyers lean;
    No snowy fingers test the lace,
      Or ribbons blue and green;
    In vain are Melnotte’s prices
      Raised up to three-and-three;
    And vainly advertises
      The Steamboat Company!

    This year no golden harvest
      Shall prima donnas reap;
    This year no Baden Croupier
      Shall shear the travelling sheep;
    And the landladies of Brighton,
      Shall wail o’er cliff and down,
    Those cruel season tickets,
      That keep the world in town!

      *       *       *       *       *

    But meanwhile, preparations
      Are briskly carried on;
    And agonized exhibitors
      Are told they must begone.
    The floor is swept and sprinkled,
      The panes are polished bright,
    And all that isn’t finished
      Is hustled out of sight.

    Then come the season tickets,
      In carriage, cab, and brougham;
    And long before eleven,
      There is scarcely standing room;
    And as at every instant
      The ladies’ ranks increase,
    Pretty, to see the skirmishes
      They have with the police.

    But lo, the cry is “_Paxton!_”
      And as the waves divide,
    The Architect of crystal
      Comes forth with modest pride.
    Well may all voices cheer him,
      When they see what he has done;
    For such a graceful victory
      No mortal ever won!

    Now Statesmen and Ambassadors
      From all the globe flock in;
    And that warm-hearted gentleman,
      The Chinese Mandarin.
    And with his gallant comrade,
      The first in danger’s van,
    Comes England’s white-haired Hero,
      To welcome PEACE TO MAN.

    But when the face of Arthur
      Is seen amid the throng,
    A cheer that shakes the crystal roof,
      Bursts forth the ranks among.
    On the benches smiles no beauty
      But would his hand have kissed;
    For the fairest lip were honoured
      To touch that brown old fist.

    And when weak-minded foreigners
      Ask what it’s all about,
    With what enthusiastic pride
      All haste to point him out!
    “Now, welcome, welcome, Arthur!”
      The greetings still increase:
    “Thrice welcome on thy birthday morn,
      “To the Waterloo of Peace!”

      *       *       *       *       *

    Since five o’clock this morning,
      Nay, some have said, before,
    The folks have been collecting
      By myriads and more.
    Franticly strive officials
      To keep the passage free:
    As well might Brighton lobsters
      Attempt to stop the sea!

    For like a herd scholastic,
      Let loose from desk and form,
    John Bull and all his family,
      Carry the Park by storm.
    From Palace e’en to Palace,
      Can only heads be seen,
    That pushing past, in wild career,
    Policeman, Guardsman, Grenadier,
      Rush on to meet the Queen.

    Then round our good Victoria,
      As slowly on she past,
    A hundred winged whispers
      Come floating thick and fast.
    “What if these millions rise in arms?
      “Think on the Bourbon’s fate!
    “What if but _one_ assail thee?
      “Back--ere it be too late!”

    Round gazed she, as not deigning
      Such fears to entertain:
    Yes--if indeed they hated her,
      Then had she lived in vain!
    For the people’s glow of welcome
      Is the Monarch’s purest gem--
    And her heart was calm and confident
      In its honest love for _them_!

    “O England--gallant England!
      “So tried--and yet so true!
    “You will not do your sovereign wrong,
      “Who trusts her all to you!”
    So she spake, and smiling showed
      The young heir by her side,
    And mid a thunder of applause,
      Sailed through the living tide.

    And now she gains the Transept,
      And now her royal throne:
    Now burst the sweet young voices,
      And swells the organ’s tone:
    Now with her Lord and children,
      And smiles of winning grace,
    She passes through the joyous crowd,
      That all may see her face.

    And that face will be remembered
      To many a distant day,
    When the glitter of the pageant
      Like a dream has passed away;
    And the frankness and the kindliness
      Of that auspicious scene,
    Shall link with all our better thoughts,
      Our English-hearted Queen!

    And in the homes of labour,
      When all have learnt to know
    The one sweet tie of brotherhood
      God knit for man below--
    When honest toil is resting
      Beside his quiet hearth,
    And forgets the gloom of forge and loom,
      In his children’s fearless mirth;

    When the wrongs are all forgiven,
      And the law of kindness rules,
    When the swords are turned to ploughshares,
      And the prisons into schools;
    When rich and poor together,
      Flock to the House of Prayer,
    And not a cloud of bitterness
      Disturbs the sunshine _there_;

    When the actors in this pageant
      Have all been laid to rest,
    And the youngest head among us,
      Is white as Snowdon’s crest;
    May that glad generation
      Recal this glorious day,
    And Labour’s first Ovation,
      Upon the First of May!

                                A TALE.


“The charm of this pretty rural tale is, that it gives a faithful
picture of life and manners in an English country parish in our own
times. It bears that stamp of historical value which Jeffrey praised in
the novels of Fielding. To those at a distance from such scenes, to the
dwellers in great towns, for instance, or to Scotch cousins or American
friends, or to any who wish to know what goes on in English Village Life
in the days of Queen Victoria, we would say, amongst other books, read
Miss Drury’s tale of ‘Eastbury.’”

                                                    _Literary Gazette._

“Another book, still nearer to the elaboration of the novel in its
analysis of society, its development of character, and its
conversational vivacity--a book of singular moral beauty united with
artistic skill--may be added to our little catalogue. It is called
_Eastbury_--and is also the production of a lady. There is a great deal
of quiet but constant action in this book--not merely outward movement,
but mental emotion; it is strewn over with pictures of country life and
scenery painted in with remarkable minuteness and effect; the characters
that pass across the scene are people we all know perfectly well, and
are sure to remember when we meet them again; and with a strong tinge of
sincere religious feeling all through, it displays an intimate knowledge
of particular phases of the world, which it pourtrays without the least
tendency to that sort of pious affectation which so often destroys the
efficacy of the religious novel. This may be said to be a religious
novel in its spirit, which is sweet and full of goodness; in all else it
paints society as we see it around us.”.... From the Article “_Little
Books with Large Aims_.”

provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
